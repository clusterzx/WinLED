# WinLED - WLED Client for Windows

WinLED lets you control your WLED instance from your Desktop. There is no need to open your browser, get your iPhone or talk to Alexa.
WinLED gives you the ability to change colors, presets you created, effects and color palettes. Even so it comes handy in place when
your PC starts - just tell it what preset you want to play! 

Therefore it has a colorpicker wheel where you can change the color of your static light while moving the mouse.
